# Roku Flashback

## Intro
This is a project that aims to create a new app under the Roku umbrella, called Roku Flashback. It's a streaming app focused on retro content produced up till the late 90s. All the relevant content is to be pulled from a database with PHP and Vue.JS, in accordance with the project requirements, and appropriately styled with SCSS/SASS.

Still in the prototyping phase for now. The main design guidelines are solid and mostly done, tho there's still room for refinement. WEB Prototype is working as intended and MOBILE version should come soon after. All of the relevant design files can be found inside the "includes" folder of this repo. It will be constantly updated up till the project's completion.
#### Prototypes
[WEB](https://xd.adobe.com/view/498bd617-a680-480e-8be4-0fdd244b5a96-1cd8/?fullscreen&hints=off)

MOBILE: TBA
#### Assets
Placeholders pretty much everywhere for now. Lot's of empty boxes as well. That should change as we pick up the pace and start implementing our goals and hitting those milestones described in the main doc.

### Development
PHP connection is in process, the database is already created in PMA, the PHP connection has to have several functions in order to fetch all the neccessary data in a good manner. Vue Js components will come after this and then when the html and CSS is created the fucntions in PHP and JS will be creating, meanwhile the researching of information and different tools Vue offers is a need. Each week there will be a commit with some updates.
