## Intro
This is a project that aims to create a new app under the Roku umbrella, called Roku Flashback. It's a streaming app focused on retro content produced up till the late 90s. All the relevant content is to be pulled from a database with PHP and Vue.JS, in accordance with the project requirements, and appropriately styled with SCSS/SASS.
For more detailed information about the scope and current status of the project's development, refer to the [DESIGN DOCUMENT](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PotuLRZd_NACGDrCuLhelIapcthBduG3xjNqrJ7mCSo/edit?usp=sharing)

#### Assets
Placeholders pretty much everywhere for now. Lot's of empty boxes as well. That should change as we pick up the pace and start implementing our goals and hitting those milestones described in the main doc.

### Development
PHP connection is in process, the database is already created in PMA, the PHP connection has to have several functions in order to fetch all the neccessary data in a good manner. Vue Js components will come after this and then when the html and CSS is created the fucntions in PHP and JS will be creating, meanwhile the researching of information and different tools Vue offers is a need. Each week there will be a commit with some updates.
