IMPLEMENTATION IDEAS

- Start up with a login screen

- If user logs in as parent/admin, direct them to a profile selection screen that contains all of the profiles linked to their account

- Elsewise, direct them to a profile selection that contains only the kids profiles within the same account

- Clicking on a regular profile directs the user to a netflix-like dashboard with 3 carrousels, each filled with thumbnails from their respective categories and all of these clickable and linking to a video/music file.

- Clicking on a kids profile directs the user to a more kid-friendly dashboard (think nick+ or something similar) that builds up on the regular one, but with colorful backgrounds and playful iconography to make navigation more intuitive and engaging for younger audiences.

- Kids dashboard should have more micro-interactions with graphical assets and icons, while regular dashboard should look more like the regular roku sticks interfaces.
